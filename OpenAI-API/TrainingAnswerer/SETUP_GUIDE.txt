# Quick Setup Guide for Executable

## ✅ How to Set Up Your API Key

When running the `.exe` file, place your `.env` file in the **same folder** as the executable:

```
dist/
  ├── TrainingQA-Helper.exe
  └── .env                    ← Put your .env file here!
```

### Your .env File

Create a file named `.env` (no extension before the dot!) with this content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

## 📋 Step by Step

1. **Copy your `.env` file** to the `dist/` folder
2. **Make sure it's named exactly**: `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
3. **Run the executable**: `TrainingQA-Helper.exe`

## 🔍 The App Will Search For .env In These Locations:

1. ✅ `.env` (same folder as .exe) - **RECOMMENDED**
2. ✅ `Environment-Variables/.env` (subfolder)
3. ✅ `../Environment-Variables/.env` (for development)

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "API key not found in environment variables!"

**Problem**: `.env` file is not in the correct location

**Solution**: Copy `.env` to the same folder as `TrainingQA-Helper.exe`

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found in .env file!"

**Problem**: The `.env` file doesn't have the API key line

**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

### File shows as ".env.txt" in File Explorer

**Problem**: Windows is hiding file extensions

**Solution**: 
1. Open File Explorer
2. View → Show → File name extensions (check the box)
3. Rename the file to remove `.txt` if present

## 📦 For Distribution

When sharing your app with others, create a `.env.template` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=paste-your-key-here
```

Then tell users to:
1. Rename `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Replace `paste-your-key-here` with their actual API key

---

**That's it!** Your executable will now find the API key. 🚀
