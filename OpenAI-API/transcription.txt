Deux Oseai's got nothing on you Scotland You know I'm ready for a lip-synch here with you I can feel it, I can feel it now, we're coming alive Gotta get together, gonna live forever tonight Ain't nothing better than feeling like we're coming alive Gotta get together, gonna live forever tonight Ain't nothing better than feeling like we're coming alive Gotta get together, gonna live forever tonight Ain't nothing better than feeling like we're coming alive What is up, World Wide Web? Thanks for tuning in to Office Hours number three Pretty stoked on this, I have a guest that I got to know a little bit this week which I'll introduce in a second, but before that we just have a few just a few housekeeping items to take care of Office Hours is meant for us to, for a moment, to offer a bit of inspiration to creatives during this time and it's just like a weird time with the pandemic and everything and as a creative it's a little hard because you can't really go out and create so that's the purpose of Office Hours is to inspire you guys and just encourage you to get out and create but also encourage you guys to check out our film festival, which is MIF we put it on every year and it's usually hosted in New York but obviously that's off the table right now so this year we actually moved it all online, which is really rad because as much as we'll miss seeing everyone in New York the whole playing field is open now for everyone to submit a film so MIF is now open, it used to only be 21 and up and now it's for whoever, if you're under 18 you can get a parent and guardian signature and you can still participate in MIF and you have a few weeks to submit your films that will be info in a link probably down below and such but with that too, one of the reasons that MIF is happening is because of our sponsors for it without them, they've been awesome, they've just been rolling with the punches with all the changes and direction it's going and now that it's moved all online, they've still stuck with us huge thank you to our sponsorships in that too we're still able to give out prize money so you can submit your films to one of the categories and if you win, there's prize money and this is all because of our sponsors so again, big thanks to them and last thank you before we get into it is to CreativeLive the reason why you're watching Office Hours is because of them there's someone behind the screen that's way smarter than me that knows a lot about live broadcasting and how to do all these fancy transitions between us and our guests so big thanks to them and they've also been nice enough to let us use their studios for a lot of the MIF filming coming up so big shout out to CreativeLive, to our sponsors and all that and so with that, let's talk to our guest, Oliver Hughes how's it going? How you doing Andrew? Thanks for having me on, I'm super excited to be here yeah, likewise so you said this is all about just talking about filmmaking and the aspects of it in hopes to encourage people to get out and create a bit more how did you find filmmaking and what is your specialty, what is your niche in filmmaking? right, well I originally found filmmaking in 2014 by just having a good friendship with a guy who had started a freelance career but before that, I wanted to begin a career in actual film scoring so I went to school in Nashville to be a film composer learn audio production, music production and then long story short, petered out, gave up, quit gave up all my dreams, decided I should wear slacks and khakis and go sell windows for a living which I did ended up in Denver, then came back to Kansas City where I grew up and tried to start a regular big boy career and it didn't really work out, and I'm really thankful for that because I had a chance encounter with this freelancer, his name was Bobby and we started working together he knew I had done creative video stuff in high school and before that and because of my music background, I kind of brought an audio expertise to his incredible cinematography chops, and we made a great team and so from there on, I started my own freelance business and that's kind of how I got here but the audio thing has always been the big core of what I do yeah, right on I actually used to play drums, I didn't tell you that earlier but I played drums, so I actually had quite a bit of experience in music and getting back into, a lot of my editing has actually revolved around music I actually find a lot of inspiration, I will often times choose the music first I think it's a huge part of films people that are always posting stuff like music takes the longest to find I'm like, no, I already know the music before I start the thing I agree, I think it's underrated quite a bit so with that too, I watched quite a bit of your YouTube channel and even as someone who edits for a living, I learned so much I watched your auto-ducking video and I was like, sick I just literally saved 30 minutes on every future project good, huge so with your YouTube channel, you have this mix of a few documentaries a lot of lesson stuff, a lot of just about your personal life what do you enjoy most about creating on YouTube specifically around the audio content, whether it's documentary or tutorials well, honestly, I love the documentary style of filmmaking that's where I really want to go with things but I also love just talking about audio tools so I think that's a place where they both coincide and then when I release something, it's like the amount of effort I put into the actual sound of the film has to be next level because that's what I talk about, so there's no skimping there so I think they kind of go hand in hand it's like, when we talk about gear when we talk about filmmaking processes or audio tools or ways of making things sound better at the end of the day, those are just small pieces of the puzzle of sharing story because if you get better sound for your film you're bringing us closer to the story that you're trying to tell so at the end of the day, the massive, overarching 40,000 foot theme is storytelling and audio is a piece of that I love that, it's just a small piece to the overall puzzle I think that's such a good philosophy of it I like what you said earlier too, to me you said that the same thing as cameras, audio is a similar way that if you, as filmmakers, we can get thrown a phone and make a video, make a film out of it and call it a day but it's also the same thing with audio a huge part of it is understanding your environment and how to work with it, and how important acoustics are you could buy a $5,000 mic but if you're filming it in a tiled bathroom it's not going to go so well I would be curious to hear what you have to say on the idea of how people, if they're making films on their phone what could they do to record audio or improve their audio to maybe edit in later, or even also raw audio during their filming there's a couple things to think about when we're doing just phone-type filmmaking because when we talk about audio, there's a whole range of things inside that that we talk about, one of them is dialogue many modern commercial films, personal films, YouTubes are driven by a dialogue narrative, and that's voiceover or interview content, or any sort of other driven narrative by the voice now that is over here in this kind of piece of the pie it must be in mono, it cannot ever be in stereo or it will ruin your mix so how to do that with an iPhone you would need to get in an acoustic environment that is suitable to not have a bunch of echoes and stuff because iPhones won't really help you out you have to just kind of create that for them and so, say you want to record a voiceover for your project go into your bedroom, get under the sheets make sure you're not rustling in the sheets just totally dampen everything, record it into your iPhone and then in post, make it a mono signal and like, you're going to have a pretty darn good voiceover on the other side, for natural sound, fully any sort of other sounds that are in your mix for video the iPhone's actually a great tool, it records in stereo so you're getting a left and a right signal coming into your phone and stereo's really cool because it just kind of tricks us into thinking we're hearing like the crispiest audio ever when really it's just two signals that mirror the way our ears hear and it's just more pleasing to listen to that way the old school film school, I just said school twice, which is dope but the old way of thinking is if what you're looking at is wider than your face you should record it in stereo if it's not, you should record it in mono I don't really adhere to that as much it's more like, what do you want people to experience from your film and so, with the iPhone, the only problem you run into is wind because the wind will clip out the speakers we've all heard that terrible noise everyone's experienced that, yeah right, so that's the only big thing you have to watch out for if you're trying to record that sounds out in the field trying to get like, ambiance but yeah, just separate those two things when you're thinking about recording with your iPhone and don't be afraid to re-record later because the reality is, when we're out there doing this a lot of times when I'm filming you can hear me breathing and grunting and making all sorts of terrible sounds and that's why the people that run the fancy cameras on sets have a separate audio guy so, anyway, that's what I would say watch out for the wind and record in your bedsheets I like that one thing for those who don't know could you explain a little bit what is stereo sound and what is mono? yes, totally so that literally just refers to how many signals are coming out so mono, meaning one it's just one signal that is split between both speakers it's the exact same sound and you can think of it as just in the center of the image of sound that you're hearing a lot of processors like Premiere or Audition or whatever you're using you can kind of go into the audio settings convert things from stereo to mono you can flip it out and do it anyway stereo is the left and the right being separate signals coming in and then separate signals coming out so again, if you're thinking of having two speakers in front of you while you're watching your film we're not talking about 5.1 or anything complicated a stereo signal will come two different sounds to your ears at the same time creating a wider, more realistic soundscape and that's again why if you ever record dialogue stuff in stereo it'll really mess with the mix and make everyone confused and so, yeah, so a stereo, like let's say I'm filming you right now and something to the left of me happens you would hear it in the left speaker more so correct yeah so then if you have to use this for dialogue only record it, but then when you get into Premiere make sure it is summed down to mono and we can make a video about that later if you don't know how do you have a tutorial on that on your YouTube? actually, no, but now I have a good new idea so make that time right on so speaking of that I saw a ton of your like I said, I was watching some of your YouTube content on just audio like just a bunch of how to literally make it better and I learned a bunch but for the people who are making these films for MIF and all this stuff I watched the video that you did with us where you explained a lot and you showed with your hands very well how audio was working what are some just good audio tips like more so what are some good audio effects in Premiere to note to increase just the better quality of your audio right, so compression is the number one compressors confuse everybody because when you talk to audio people about compressors it's like hearing a college lecture and it's the saddest most boring thing ever and it sounds like you're reading a text and so I exist to demystify the compressor because it's the most valuable tool that you'll run into and the reason it's valuable is because what it does to the audio you talked about me using my hands I love to use my hands but it like in a sense compressor takes your entire dynamic range from the softest sound to the loudest sound and just squeezes it together it just compresses the actual sound this is not video compression this is not data that's a whole different compression and how that word is used this is literally compressing the dynamic range of your audio now why would you want to do that Mr. Carnes? the reason you want to do that is because your dialogue or your voiceover whatever is leading your narrative forward that compression will then bring the fullness of that sound and allow it to sit at the top of the mix totally clean and unobstructed by the peaks and valleys of the sound beneath it so a compressor is critical if you want a clear and rich and crispy mix okay I definitely used a compressor but I never realized exactly what it does until I watched that video of you explain it it's similar to how colors work in a way if you want to flatten your colors for more data or whatever you shoot in log which puts it all in this section and then yeah but with that you kind of spread it out with coloring not so much leave it the same right, right but similar idea for sure right on are there any other effects that you, is like always a go-to for you?
